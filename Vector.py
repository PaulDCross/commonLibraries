class Vector(object):
    """Vector(x, y)

    Parameters
    ==========
    x   = the x component
    y   = the y component

    Attributes
    ==========
    x   = the x component of this vector determined by the parameter x.
    y   = the y component of this vector determined by the parameter y.
    pos = a list containing the x and y components of this vector.

    Methods
    =======
    add(other)          = returns a Vector object whose x and y components are determined by adding together the x components of this vector and another vector and adding together the y components of this vector and another vector.
    sub(other)          = returns a Vector object whose x and y components are determined by subtracting together the x components of this vector and another vector and ubtracting together the y components of this vector and another vector.
    dot(other)          = returns the dot product of this vector and the vector 'other'.
    mag                 = returns the magnitude of this vector.
    unit                = returns a Vector object which is this vector's unit vector.
    mulScalar(scalar)   = returns a Vector object whose x and y components are determined by multiplying the components with the scalar value.
    mulVector(vector)   = returns a Vector object whose x and y components are determined by multiplying together the x components of this vector and another vector and multiplying together the y components of this vector and another vector.
